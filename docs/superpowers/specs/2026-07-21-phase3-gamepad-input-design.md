# Phase 3 — Global Gamepad Input — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Target device:** ClockworkPi uConsole (Raspberry Pi CM4) with j1n6 QMK firmware
**Fork:** `git@github.com:btquan/BrickEmuPy-uConsole.git`
**Depends on:** Phase 2 (handheld GameScreen) — merged to `main`.
**Status:** Approved design, ready for implementation planning
**Priority:** Brick games first.

## 1. Overview

Let the uConsole's physical gamepad drive any game. In the firmware's **Game
Mode (Fn+G)**, the buttons and D-pad emit **Linux joystick events** on
`/dev/input/js0` (not keyboard keys). A background reader translates those
events into canonical **roles**, maps each role to a game button via an editable
global profile (`uconsole.json`) with optional per-`.brick` overrides, and feeds
them to the emulator through the existing button-press path. Keyboard input keeps
working unchanged alongside it.

## 2. Captured hardware mapping (measured on device, Game Mode on)

`/dev/input/js0`, Linux joystick API (`struct js_event { u32 time; s16 value;
u8 type; u8 number; }`, 8 bytes):

| Physical button | js0 event |
|---|---|
| A / B / X / Y | button 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 |
| Select / Start | button 4 / 5 |
| D-pad Left / Right | axis 0 = −32767 / +32767 (0 = released) |
| D-pad Up / Down | axis 1 = −32767 / +32767 (0 = released) |

D-pad is digital (full-scale ±32767). Buttons: value 1 = press, 0 = release.

## 3. Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals**
- Read `js0` and drive the active game with the D-pad + A/B/X/Y/Select/Start.
- Editable global profile (`uconsole.json`): js0 layout + role→button mapping.
- Per-`.brick` override of role→button.
- ControlsPanel shows the gamepad control for each game button.
- Keyboard `hot_keys` still work (no change to that path).
- Default profile encodes: **Start→btnStart, Select→btnMute, A→btnRotate**,
  D-pad L/R/Down → move, **Up separate (not rotate)**, B→btnRotate.

**Non-Goals (later / out of scope)**
- Analog sticks, multiple gamepads, L/R shoulder buttons (unmapped for now).
- In-app remap UI (edit `uconsole.json` instead).
- Making the emulator itself gamepad-aware (all mapping lives in the shell).

## 4. Roles

Canonical role strings, independent of any game's button names:
`DPAD_UP, DPAD_DOWN, DPAD_LEFT, DPAD_RIGHT, BTN_A, BTN_B, BTN_X, BTN_Y,
BTN_SELECT, BTN_START`.

## 5. `uconsole.json` (shipped default, user-editable)

```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "0": "BTN_A", "1": "BTN_B", "2": "BTN_X", "3": "BTN_Y",
    "4": "BTN_SELECT", "5": "BTN_START"
  },
  "axes": {
    "0": {"negative": "DPAD_LEFT", "positive": "DPAD_RIGHT"},
    "1": {"negative": "DPAD_UP",   "positive": "DPAD_DOWN"}
  },
  "axis_threshold": 16000,
  "roles": {
    "DPAD_LEFT":  ["btnLeft"],
    "DPAD_RIGHT": ["btnRight"],
    "DPAD_DOWN":  ["btnDown"],
    "DPAD_UP":    ["btnUp"],
    "BTN_A":      ["btnRotate"],
    "BTN_B":      ["btnRotate"],
    "BTN_X":      [],
    "BTN_Y":      [],
    "BTN_START":  ["btnStart"],
    "BTN_SELECT": ["btnMute", "btnSelect"]
  }
}
```

Each role maps to an ordered list of **candidate** game-button names; resolution
picks the first candidate that exists in the game's `config["buttons"]`. Empty
list or no match → the role does nothing for that game (e.g. `DPAD_UP` on a brick
game that has no `btnUp`).

## 6. Role → game-button resolution (pure)

`resolve_role(role, config, profile) -> str | None`:
1. If the game's `config` has `"input_map"` and it contains `role`, return that
   button name (per-game override) — even if the button doesn't exist, so a
   game can deliberately point a role somewhere specific.
2. Else walk `profile["roles"][role]` candidates; return the first that is a key
   of `config["buttons"]`.
3. Else `None`.

Per-`.brick` override example (optional block in a `.brick`):
`"input_map": {"BTN_A": "btnRotate", "BTN_B": "btnOnOff"}`.

## 7. Components

### `handheld/js_events.py` — pure joystick decoding
- `parse_js_event(data8: bytes) -> (kind, number, value)` where kind is
  `"button"`/`"axis"`/`"init"` (init = the 0x80 startup flag, ignored by callers).
- `AxisTracker`: given `axis_threshold` and the axes config, converts axis
  value changes into role press/release transitions (crossing +threshold →
  positive role pressed; returning toward 0 → released; direction flips release
  the old role and press the new). Pure, deterministic, unit-tested.
- `button_role(number, profile)` / `axis_roles(number, profile)`: look up roles
  from the profile. Pure.

### `handheld/input_map.py` — pure resolution + profile load
- `load_profile(path) -> dict` (reads `uconsole.json`; returns a built-in
  default if the file is missing so the app still runs).
- `resolve_role(role, config, profile) -> str | None` (§6).
- `control_hints(config, profile) -> list[(button_name, [role,...])]` — inverse
  map for the ControlsPanel: for each game button, which roles resolve to it.

### `handheld/gamepad.py` — Qt/IO reader
- `GamepadReader(QThread)` with signals `rolePressed(str)`, `roleReleased(str)`.
- Opens `/dev/input/js0` non-blocking (`os.open` + `select` with a timeout) so
  `stop()` exits promptly. If the device is absent or unreadable (dev Mac, Game
  Mode off), it emits nothing and exits cleanly — keyboard input is unaffected.
- Uses `js_events` to decode; emits role transitions for buttons and axes.

### `uconsole.json`
- Shipped at repo root (or `handheld/uconsole.json`); `load_profile` looks there,
  overridable via an env var or a path constant.

## 8. Changes to existing files (small, additive)

- **`brick_widget.py`**: add `pressButton(name)` / `releaseButton(name)` public
  methods that send `CMD_BTN_PRESS` / `CMD_BTN_RELEASE`; refactor
  `keyPressEvent`/`keyReleaseEvent` to call them. Behaviour identical; now
  reusable by the gamepad path.
- **`handheld/game_screen.py`**: construct a `GamepadReader`, load the profile,
  connect `rolePressed`/`roleReleased` → resolve role → `brick.pressButton/
  releaseButton`; stop the reader in `close()`.
- **`handheld/controls_panel.py`**: render the gamepad legend from
  `control_hints` — for each game button, show its label and the physical
  control(s) via a role→symbol map
  (`DPAD_LEFT→"◄", DPAD_RIGHT→"►", DPAD_UP→"▲", DPAD_DOWN→"▼", BTN_A→"A",
  BTN_B→"B", BTN_X→"X", BTN_Y→"Y", BTN_START→"Start", BTN_SELECT→"Select"`).
  Buttons with no bound control are omitted or shown as unmapped.

## 9. Data flow

```
js0 8-byte event
  → js_events.parse → (kind, number, value)
  → button_role / AxisTracker → role transition (pressed/released)
  → GamepadReader emits rolePressed/roleReleased  [GUI thread via queued signal]
  → GameScreen: resolve_role(role, config, profile) → button name
  → BrickWidget.pressButton(name) → CMD_BTN_PRESS → emulator
```

## 10. Error handling / edge cases

- `js0` absent/unreadable → GamepadReader no-ops; app runs on keyboard only.
- Game Mode off → js0 yields no gamepad events (buttons act as keys); documented.
- Malformed/short read on js0 → skip; thread continues.
- Missing/invalid `uconsole.json` → built-in default profile.
- Role resolving to `None` → ignored (no press sent).
- Multiple roles → same button (e.g. A and B → btnRotate): reference-count
  presses so releasing one held button doesn't cancel another still held.

## 11. Testing

- **Pure (run anywhere):** `parse_js_event` (button/axis/init framing);
  `AxisTracker` (threshold crossings, direction flips, center release);
  `resolve_role` (override > candidates > none); `control_hints` inverse map;
  `load_profile` (missing file → default).
- **Qt/IO:** `GamepadReader` fed a fake fd (an `os.pipe` with pre-written
  js_event frames) → asserts it emits the expected role signals and stops
  cleanly; absence path (bad path) emits nothing and exits.
- **On-device:** Game Mode on; play E-23 — D-pad moves, A/B rotate, Start =
  start, Select = mute, Up does nothing (no `btnUp`); ControlsPanel shows the
  gamepad legend; keyboard still works with Game Mode off.

## 12. Milestones (implementation-plan tasks)

1. `js_events.py` (parse + button/axis role lookup) + tests.
2. `AxisTracker` (in `js_events.py`) + tests.
3. `input_map.py` (`load_profile`, `resolve_role`, `control_hints`) + `uconsole.json` + tests.
4. `brick_widget.py`: `pressButton`/`releaseButton` + refactor key events + reference-count presses.
5. `gamepad.py`: `GamepadReader` QThread + fake-fd Qt/IO test.
6. `game_screen.py` wiring + `controls_panel.py` gamepad legend.
7. On-device acceptance (Game Mode gameplay + legend + keyboard fallback).

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Reference counting for shared buttons gets out of sync | Track a per-button held-role set in GameScreen; press on first, release on last |
| js0 blocking read stalls shutdown | `select` with timeout; `stop()` flag checked each loop |
| Game Mode must be on for gamepad | Documented; keyboard remains a full fallback |
| Other games use different button names | Candidate lists + per-`.brick` `input_map`; brick games covered by default |
